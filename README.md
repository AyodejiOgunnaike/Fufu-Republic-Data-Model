### 1. Mapping Out the Necessary Entities, Relationships, and Constraints

#### Key Entities:

- Customers: Representing the individuals ordering food.
- Orders: Transactions that track purchases made by customers.
- Menu Items: The food and drink options available at each branch.
- Locations (Branches): Outlets where Fufu Republic operates.
- Payments: How customers pay (cash, debit card, online).
- Inventory: Stock levels of ingredients or menu items at each location
  
#### Relationships:

- Each customer can make multiple orders.
- Each order contains one or more menu items.
- Each order is placed at a specific location (branch).
- Each payment is tied to an order and can have various payment methods.
  
#### Constraints:

- Menu items must exist before they can be ordered.
- Payments must match an order's total value.
- Inventory should align with customer demand per location to prevent stock shortages or excess.
  
### 2. Creating a Dimensional Model

#### Business Process:

- Sales Tracking and Stock Management

#### Business Questions:

- What are the total sales by branch, payment method, and dining option (dine-in, take-out, online)?
- How can we predict demand for specific menu items to manage stock levels efficiently?
- Which customers are likely to respond to personalized promotions based on past purchases?
  
#### Identify Grain, Dimensions, and Facts:

1. Grain: The grain of the fact table is one row per order at a specific location, with payment and dining details.
